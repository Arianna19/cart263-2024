/**
Ai Jam: Draw for Me in Thin Air
Arianna Narita

Making my first AI project using ml5.js
The idea is to make the user draw an image and make the computer guess it 
See if the computer is able to accurately guess whats happening while user is drawing something
1. User will have to use their camera
2. Use the ml5.js classifying and drawing components
