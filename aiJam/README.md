# Ai Jam Project

--EXTENSION GIVEN UNTIL: SATURDAY MARCH 2ND--

Overall concept is that the users says an animal in the list given by an array and the computer prints/draws out a doodle from the ml5.js library. I mixed both audio from the previous lesson and ai with the drawing libray from ml5.js in this prototype. 

Challenges: 
Figuring out the array and getting the computer to hear and link the animal to what user is saying 
JUST ARRAYS IN GENERAL

Funs: 
Enjoying how ml5.js draws certain animals from their library 
Having a program that interacts immediately with the user 
A mini drawing chatgbt but with audio!?
