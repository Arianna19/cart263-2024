/**
Voices Jam : The guessing game
Arianna Narita

This simulation is basically very simple since it's my first time using audio/voice in a project.
The goal: Guess the character based off of the colour blocks being shown 
Speech aspect: The user has to vocally say the character and the computer will wait until the right answer is said
