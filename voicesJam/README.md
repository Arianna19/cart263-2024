# Voices Jam: A Fun Guessing Game

Author: Arianna Narita 

This simulation is basically very simple since it's my first time using audio/voice in a project.
The goal: Guess the movie/series/show based off of the colour blocks being shown 
Speech aspect: The user has to vocally say the movie and the computer will wait until the right answer is said by comparing it with the asnwer provided in the code.

Process that I took: (start with 6 levels of difficulty) //little list I created to help me
1. Create an array of images which will be the colour blocks 
2. Create a detection function of audio 
3. Function that will notice the right answer
4. Change the screen when guessed right
