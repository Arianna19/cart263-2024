# Voices Jam: A Fun Guessing Game

Author: Arianna Narita 

Basically a super simple game since it's my first time tampering with speech in code. The concept is to guess the show just my seeing colour blocks of certain characters. The way this simulation uses the speech concepts is that it asks the user to say the show to the computer. The program compares if what was said matches the answer given in the code and displays if the answer is right or wrong. In total there are 6 shows to guess!
