--KIRBY MATCHING GAME--

Overall idea is that user has to match the same kirbies together that pop up on the screen amongst the different ones. Basically find the matching pair. The user has to find the most as possible before the barking timer runs out.  

Challenges: 
Definetely trying to understand the Phaser 3 syntax at the last minute not realizing how complex and different it is to what I've previously learned 
Definetely a very constricting exercise and language from what I noticed 
SYNTAX SYNTAX SYNTAX 
Probably time management idk. 

Funs: 
Making the game pretty
Finding fun sprite images
Making the code my own ishhhhh

Key Takeway:
Phaser is hard 
I don't like Phaser 
P5.js is nicer than Phaser
