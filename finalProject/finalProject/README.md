# Final Project: 

This prototype is mostly a test on how I'm going to go about this Final Project "aesthetical wise", for now I only want to test out what colours or vibe I really want to go on based off of my proposal. I'm really playing with imagery and colour palette. At the moment it might look like a rainbow fiasco, this is only because a major goal of this project is me pimping up the original Ai Jam and learning how to play with HTML, JS, P5.js and ml5.js all together. 

Also adding more animals to make it funner and more diverse







////The following is just a reminder of what this program initially does from the Ai Jam project////

Overall concept is that the users says an animal in the list given by an array and the computer prints/draws out a doodle from the ml5.js library. I mixed both audio from the previous lesson and ai with the drawing libray from ml5.js in this prototype. 

Challenges: 
Figuring out the array and getting the computer to hear and link the animal to what user is saying 
JUST ARRAYS IN GENERAL

Funs: 
Enjoying how ml5.js draws certain animals from their library 
Having a program that interacts immediately with the user 
A mini drawing chatgbt but with audio!?

HTML AND CSS ARE used to display the lists of the animals





1. Be able to choose the colour of the stroke by clicking on circles
2. Be able to choose the width of the stroke (three different types of widths)
3. Make it prettier (font, kirby vibes)
